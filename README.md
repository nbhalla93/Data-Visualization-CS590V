# Data-Visualization-CS590V-
Visualization of Australian Forest Fire and its Impacts on Biodiversity and Humans

**ABSTRACT**

Wildfires are a natural part of many ecosystems, providing essential cleansing of the forest floors
from the debris. However, because of the rising temperature of the earth, reducing rainfall, high winds and
many other manmade and natural reasons, Australian fire seasons lately have been unprecedented with
fire seasons being longer, severe and more frequent. The goal of our project is to design and implement
visualization systems for analysing the spread and impact of the bushfires that occurred across the
Australian region from late 2019 to early 2020. Along with demonstrating the presence and spread of fire
across different geographical areas, we are also going to show its impact on the humans, wildlife and the
overall climate of the area in order to emphasize the magnitude of the devastating impact this event has
created.
We believe the findings and insights from our work could be helpful for the local communities,
environmentalists and government agencies in answering a multitude of questions. Our work in particular
will help gain insights into why this fire season is so much worse than the previous ones based on
climate related variables like temperature and rainfall. Also, our visualizations can be helpful in coping
with the future fire seasons and prevent them from becoming disastrous. We also aim to help concerned
users and any other third parties in providing an assessment of the overall damage caused by the fire.
