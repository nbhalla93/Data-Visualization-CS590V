      <dd style="color:white;">This is a visualization which we built as a part of COMPSCI 590V : Data Visualization course at UMass Amherst.

      <dd style="color:white;">
        <p>Wildfires are a natural part of many ecosystems, providing essential cleansing of the forest floors from the debris. However, because of the rising temperature of the earth, reducing rainfall, high winds and many other manmade and natural reasons, Australian fire seasons lately have been unprecedented with fire seasons being longer, severe and more frequent. The goal of our project is to design and implement visualization systems for analysing the spread and impact of the bushfires that occurred across the Australian region from late 2019 to early 2020. Along with demonstrating the presence and spread of fire across different geographical areas, we are also going to show its impact on the humans, wildlife and the overall climate of the area in order to emphasize the magnitude of the devastating impact this event has created. We believe the findings and insights from our work could be helpful for the local communities, environmentalists and government agencies in answering a multitude of questions. Our work in particular will help gain insights into why this fire season is so much worse than the previous ones based on climate related variables like temperature and rainfall. Also, our visualizations can be helpful in coping with the future fire seasons and prevent them from becoming disastrous. We also aim to help concerned users and any other third parties in providing an assessment of the overall damage caused by the fire.
